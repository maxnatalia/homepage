## 📎Description:
The website presents a description of my three parrots, but not only. You will also find a lot of general information about parrots like, for example nutrition.🌶🍊🍎

## 🛠Technologies:
I've used on my website some different technlogies and conventions. On the website you will find many uses and interactions of buttons. I try to use new skills all the time.

Now, I can specify such technologies and conventions as:
- HTML
- CSS

- Markdown
- BEM convention
- ES6+features
